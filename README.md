# Project 12 - Multi-page React application

In this week's project at Technigo Bootcamp 2019 we built our first multi-page React application. The goal for this week was to use an API to fetch multiple lists of movies, display them on a page and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie. I chose to add a button for showing similar movies, and also you can click on the genre-tags, to see movies in that genre.
